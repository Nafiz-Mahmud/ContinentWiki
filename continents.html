            <h1>ASIA</h1>
            <p>
            Asia (/ˈeɪʒə, ˈeɪʃə/ (About this soundlisten)) is Earth's largest
            and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and
            Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia
            with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of
            Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of
            44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of
            Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area.
            The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human
            population,[7] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its
            4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the
            world's population.[8]

    <h1>AFRICA</h1>
    <p>
     Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area.[7] With 1.3 billion people[1][2] as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite a wide range of natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita, in part due to geographic impediments,[11] legacies of European colonization in Africa and the Cold War,[12][13][14][15][16] predatory/neo-colonialistic activities by Western nations and China, and undemocratic rule and deleterious policies.[11] Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.

          <h1>NORTH AMERICA</h1>
          <p>
              North America is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be described as the northern subcontinent of a single continent, America. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. Because it is on the North American Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as part of North America geographically.

              North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the Earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third-largest continent by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population.

          <h1>SOUTH AMERICA</h1>
          <p>
              South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere[note 6] and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subcontinent of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in recent decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).[6][additional citation(s) needed]

              South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean, North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;[note 7] and one internal territory: French Guiana.[note 8] In addition, the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America.

              <h1>ANTARCTICA</h1>
              <p>
                  Antarctica (/ænˈtɑːrtɪkə/ or /ænˈtɑːrktɪkə/ (About this soundlisten))[note 1] is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At 14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly twice the size of Australia. It is by far the least populated continent, with around 5,000 people in the summer and around 1,000 in the winter. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness,[5] which extends to all but the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.[6]

                  <p>
                    Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere
                    and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost
                    peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia,[10] and is
                    bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the
                    west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east.
                    Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the
                    watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea,
                    the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterways of the
                    Turkish Straits.[11] Although much of this border is over land,
                    Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because
                    of its great physical size and the weight of its history and
                    traditions.

                      Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign
                      country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the
                      island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.[13] It is the
                      largest country by area in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest
                      country. Australia's population of nearly 26 million,[7] in an area of
                      7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300 sq mi),[14] is highly urbanised
                      and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[15] Canberra is the
                      nation's capital, while the largest city is Sydney, and other major
                      metropolitan areas include Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.
